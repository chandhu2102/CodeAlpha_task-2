# Captcha Integration with Existing Website

## Introduction
This project showcases the process of integrating various CAPTCHA services into an existing website. Integrating third-party scripts is an essential skill for web developers, as many modern websites rely on external tools and services to enhance security and user experience.

## Purpose
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the integration of different CAPTCHA services to thwart automated attacks and improve the overall security of the website. By comparing and contrasting various CAPTCHA options, we gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

## Features
- Integration of multiple CAPTCHA services to defend against bot-driven attacks.
- Practical experience in working with diverse third-party scripts, reflecting real-world web development scenarios.
- In-depth analysis of various CAPTCHA services, highlighting their pros and cons.

## Types of CAPTCHA Services Explored
